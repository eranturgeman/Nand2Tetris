This repo contain 12 projects in which I gradually built a fully functional computer - from the chips and logic gates, up to 2-tier compiler and operating system

Projects 1-5: Chips - from logic gates chips up to ALU, CPU (and extended versions of them)
Project 6: Assembler - Assembly to Binary translator
Projects 7-8: VM-Translator - VM to Assembly translator
Projects 10-11: Compiler - Jack to VM translator. Jack is low level, Java like language.
